# 🌱 PachaCredit

**PachaCredit** is an open infrastructure for **fair community microcredits in Latin America**.  
The protocol enables **community lending pools**, **small loans with simple interest**, and an **on-chain reputation score** that rewards responsible borrowers.  

---

## 🚀 Vision & Purpose

- **Financial inclusion**: Provide fair access to credit for unbanked and underbanked communities in LatAm.  
- **Transparency**: All rules are governed by smart contracts, with open and auditable transactions.  
- **Community-powered**: Local investors and cooperatives can create their own lending pools.  
- **Reputation-based**: Borrowers build an **on-chain credit score** that improves with good repayment behavior.  

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: EVM-compatible (Lisk L2 / Ethereum testnets).

### 🔹 Contract Roles
- **DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE** → Deployers / System admins  
- **MANAGER_ROLE** → Approve loans, configure pool parameters  
- **POOL_ROLE** → LoanManager contract interacts with Registry & Treasury  
- **TREASURY_ADMIN_ROLE** → Controls treasury withdrawals  

### 🔹 Key Features
- **Pool Factory**: Create multiple pools with different parameters (interest, tenor, score requirement).  
- **MicroCredit Pool**: LPs deposit stablecoins, borrowers request & repay loans.  
- **Loan Manager**: Calculates debt with simple interest by days.  
- **Credit Score**: Reputation increases with repayment (+15) and decreases with defaults (-30).  
- **Treasury**: Receives a fraction of interest (`reserveFactor`) to sustain the protocol.

## 🌐 Web App

👉 [PachaCredit dApp UI](https://v0-micro-credit-dao-design.vercel.app/)  

This interface was built using **V0 by Vercel** to quickly prototype the design and user experience of the lending flow. It allows us to demo how investors, borrowers, and managers would interact with the protocol.

---

## 🔗 Why Lisk?

We use **Lisk’s EVM-compatible L2** as the underlying blockchain because:  
- ⚡ Low fees and fast finality → suitable for microcredits.  
- 🌍 Built on Ethereum alignment → easy integration with existing tools.  
- 🛠️ Developer-friendly ecosystem with strong support for builders in hackathons.  
- 🔒 Ensures transparency and security for community-driven finance.

---

## 🏆 ENS Track Participation

We participate in the **ENS Track** because **identity and naming are crucial for financial inclusion**:  
- Borrowers and pools can be assigned **ENS subdomains** (e.g., `juan.pachacredit.eth`).  
- Makes credit records more **human-readable and portable**.  
- Enhances trust and accessibility across Web3 communities.  

---

## 🎨 V0 Participation

We also participated in **V0 (by Vercel)** to design and prototype the frontend.  
This allowed us to:  
- Quickly iterate over **UI/UX** ideas.  
- Align the design with Web3 aesthetics.
